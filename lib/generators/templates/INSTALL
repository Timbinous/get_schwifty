Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Restart your server. app/cables has been added to the load path, and it
     is necessary to restart your web server and any non-async job queues.

     ActionCable requires that you use a servers such as Puma as your development
     webserver.

  2. Ensure you're using a shared cache store. Rails by default uses an
     in-memory cache store, which can't be accessed between processes.
     http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#activesupport-cache-filestore

       # config/environments/development.rb
       config.cache_store = :file_store, "tmp/cache"

  3. Add the get_schwifty javascript to your application.js

       //= require get_schwifty

  4. Setup your first cable to get schwifty

       rails g get_schwifty:cable Dashboard fibonacci
